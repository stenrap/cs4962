========================

My final project uses the iOS camera to scan QR codes, and makes HTTP requests for
obtaining and displaying content. As such, in order to launch my final project you
must have:

	1. A current Apple Developer Program membership (and code signing identity).

	2. Access to an iOS 8.2 device (actual iOS version used during development).

	3. An Internet connection.

Note that I have included the two QR codes with which my app actually works. These
may be scanned directly from a computer screen, or printed and scanned from paper.
