    1. Tap to place the carrier on a spot that is vertically valid but not horizontally valid (i.e. on the right)
    2. Tap Rotate.
    3. Tap OK on the invalid spot alert.
    4. Tap Confirm.
    5. Tap to place the battleship.

Expected result: The battleship appears and the carrier remains in its spot.
Actual result: The battleship appears but the carrier disappears.
